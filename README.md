# Predict team winning the match.
## Develop a model to predict likelihood of a team winning the match.

### Dataset: train.csv, test.csv | Code: predict_team.py

Machine learning model uses Random Forest Classifier to attain maximum accuracy of model. A model,train with train.csv and test with test.csv. Using feature_importance getting importance features to predict team winning the match as Team1, Team2, CityOfGame, Toss(generate random of 0's and 1's). 
#### Accuracy: 91.270%.

#### Random Forest Classifier
   A random forest is a data construct applied to machine learning that develops large numbers of random decision trees analyzing sets of variables. This type of algorithm helps to enhance the ways that technologies analyze complex data.
